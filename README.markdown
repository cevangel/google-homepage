A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/cevangel/pen/XWmpJmg](https://codepen.io/cevangel/pen/XWmpJmg).

Currently okay with:
-Partially done with top left and top right tool bars
-Logo centered
-Search buttons seem alright
-Hover effects work

Difficulty with:
-Not able to see how I can insert the apps and blue "sign in" button
-Haven't started bottom toolbar
-Fitting in "magnifying glass" and "microphone" icons into search bar
